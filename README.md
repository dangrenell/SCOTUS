# SCOTUS

I wanted to quantify the extent to which the statement "this event is historical" is supported (or not) by data.

Ultimately, it does appear that Amy Coney Barrett's nomination and confirmation process are outside the norm, particularly when compared with nominations of the past 50 years.

Data on the supreme court from the [senate website](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm). Election dates are from [The Green Papers](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/PresidentialElectionEvents.phtml).
